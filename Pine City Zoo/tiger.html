                    <h3>TIGERS</h3>
                    <P>tiger, (Panthera tigris), largest member of the cat family (Felidae), rivaled only by the lion (Panthera leo) in strength and ferocity; it is a famous apex predator (meaning without a natural predator or enemy). The tiger is endangered throughout its range, which stretches from the Russian Far East through parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southeast Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The Siberian, or Amur, tiger (P. tigris altaica) is the largest, measuring up to 4 meters (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds).</P>
                    <p> The Indian, or Bengal, tiger (P. tigris tigris) is the most numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger population. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 meter (about 3 feet) and a length of about 2.2 meters (7 feet), excluding a tail of about 1 meter. Tigers weigh 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and those from the south are smaller than those of the north.</p>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                    <p>Tigers are located in the Tiger Enclosure, which is at the western side of the zoo, near the entrance.</p>
